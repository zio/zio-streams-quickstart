# ZIO Streams Quickstart

This is the simplest quickstart for a ZIO Streams application. You can download and run it very quickly. This will give you an idea of how to write similar streaming apps.

## Quickstart Guide

We have a dedicated article about this quickstart at the ZIO documentation website called [ZIO Streams Quickstart: Hello World](https://zio.dev/next/quickstarts/zio-streams-hello-world).

## Running The Example

First, open the console and clone the project using `git` (or you can simply download the project) and then change the directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:zio/zio-streams-quickstart.git 
cd zio-streams-quickstart
```

Once you are inside the project directory, run the application:

```sh
sbt run
```
